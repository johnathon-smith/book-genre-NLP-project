    "# Classifying Genre with Book Descriptions\n",

    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "__Project Goal__\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to build a model capable of accurately classifying a book's genre as Horror, Romance, Mystery and Crime, or Sci-Fi and Fantasy based on its cover blurb, or description. Does the description actually describe the book or is it just designed to sell it?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Overall Findings__\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are consistent patterns between each genre that allow them to be accurately classified.\n",
    "* My best model had a Mean Cross-Validated Accuracy of about 88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Process\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a README.md file that details my process, my findings, and instructions on how to recreate my project.\n",
    "* Acquire the data by web scraping the book descriptions and genres from the Barnes & Noble website.\n",
    "* Clean and prepare the data:\n",
    "    * Change all characters to lowercase\n",
    "    * Normalize and encode the characters\n",
    "    * Replace anything that is not a letter, number, whitespace, or a single quote\n",
    "    * Tokenize the strings\n",
    "    * Remove stop words\n",
    "    * Create Stemmed and Lemmatized versions of each string\n",
    "    * Create engineered features\n",
    "* Explore the train data set and look for identifying features for each genre.\n",
    "* Set baseline using the Dummy Classifier.\n",
    "* Create and evaluate models on train data set using GridSearchCV.\n",
    "* Choose best model and evaluate it on test data set.\n",
    "* Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.\n",
